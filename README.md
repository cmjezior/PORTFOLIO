# Chris Jezior - [About Me](https://about.me/chrisjezior)

Hello there! [Living in DC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Washington,+DC/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89b7c6de5af6e45b:0xc2524522d4885d2a?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjm4JnujOvZAhVIulMKHdPuD-IQ8gEIKzAA), I found myself diving head first into public sector marketing for enterprise IT solutions. I quickly learned the ropes of federal, state & local, and commercial marketing as I managed aspects of the Adobe Government relationship and owned [20+ complementary vendor-accounts](http://www.carahsoft.com/solve/citizen-engagement).

Now, as an Instructional Systems Designer and contractor at the [Department of Justice - Asset Forfeiture Program](https://www.justice.gov/afp), I collaborate with every team that takes part in the software development lifecycle. Learning how agencies operate internally has become an important takeaway. It's here that I quickly learned the needs of developers and realized these needs expand across every agency.

With this insight, I'd like to continue getting the right technology into the hands of those that work to improve our digital world - for me, that all starts with marketing.

## Strengths

I can conduct full life cycle marketing campaigns through content curation (creating infographics, white-papers, data sheets) & syndication, webcast administration & execution, email automation, and event/tradeshow management, while handling marketing development funds (MDF).
